# The significance of this project

- Microsoft restrictions: Microsoft Bing is a search app that avoid all sorts of risks from ChatGPT, and it is a little slow to respond, will definitely be different from ChatGPT in the future.
- ChatGPT restrictions: locale and locale mobile phone number.

There are many people who want to use free ChatGPT services, but the Internet is full of spam and copycat ChatGPT.
So I want to make a reliable ChatGPT image that is filtered out by most users through the good bad review algorithm, so that more people can use ChatGPT more easily.
